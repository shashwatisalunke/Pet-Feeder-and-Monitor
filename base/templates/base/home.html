                <p class="space">"The Commercial Automated Pet Feeder is an IOT based project which does the basic functioning of any pet feeder in the market, i.e. dispensing at timely intervals and additionally uses sensor technology to collect relevant data and in turn generate appropriate insights about the animalÂ’s eating habits. Also, the project will be pre-programmed with inbuilt instructional codes which will include the food type of animal breed associated with the gender intake. Hence, considering all the aspects and then associating the program that will be responsible for each cell in the pound or shop, the user will just have to update the project with the cell numbers and the type of animal kept in the respective cell. This way, the functioning will begin accordingly and automatic dispensing at defined time intervals will occur"</p>
